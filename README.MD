# Linear Regression From Scratch

## Description
This project implements Linear Regression from scratch using Python,
without relying on high-level machine learning libraries.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy

## How It Works
- Uses gradient descent
- Minimizes mean squared error
- Trains on sample dataset

## Future Improvements
- Add visualization
- Compare with sklearn
